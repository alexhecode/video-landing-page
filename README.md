# Video Landing Page Project

This is a project based on Brad Traversy's [video](https://youtu.be/Gx_7GQtSdpc) tutorial. This project is a website of a touring company for the fictional main setting of the [SpongeBob SquarePants](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206512/) series.

This project proved to be good practice in learning the CSS syntax, namely specific properties, values and combinators. I really enjoyed making this website!
